            htmlText:"<p>Before we answer this question, we have to know how the LED screen work.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "There is a driving method for the LED screen. We use IC to drive the LED to light up. For example each IC has 16 legs(There are 16 legs, 24 legs, 32 legs...IC), each leg drive one LED, so each 16 legs IC drive 16pcs LEDs. This is static scanning, such as P16. There is no water ripple.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "But P16 has too big pixel pitch, and because the LED industry develop fast and cost of the LED screen goes down, and higher demand of higher resolution LED screen by customer, the pixel pitch is getting smaller. The smaller pixel pitch means that more LED lamp and more IC needed for the screen. However, the size of LED can be very small, but the size of IC can not be very small and there is no such big space on PCB to install IC. So each IC have to drive more LED, for the same 16 legs IC has to drive 32pcs LED, we call it 1/2 scanning. If the same IC drive 64pcs LED, we call it 1/4 scanning, so there are static, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, 1/32...scanning method. \n" +
                "\n" +
                "So each IC drive more LEDs than the legs it has for most of the LED screen. So that means not all the LEDs will be lighted up at the same time. This is the point. A 16 legs IC drive each group of 16pcs LEDs each time, group by group, again and again. But how fast is the time? According to the refresh rate. 3840Hz has higher speed than 1920Hz. If the shutter speed of the camera is too fast, like 1/3200 second, there is no enough time for the IC to drive the LED, so there might be the water ripple happen on the photo you take. However, our eyes have visual residue or let's say our mind can not read the data so quick, that's why we can not see the water ripple with our eyes but we can see it from the photo.\n" +
                "\n" +
                "Finally, here is the 3 tips for you to take a photo of LED screen: 1. Change your position to adjust the angle to reduce water ripple. 2.Lower your camera shutter speed, try 1/60 - 1/20 second. 3. Produce a higher refresh rate LED screen, please contact Tentech.</p>",

So really, LED TVs are a subset of LCD TVs.</p>" +

                "<p>LED, which stands for “light emitting diodes,” differs from general LCD TVs in that LCDs use fluorescent lights while LEDs use those light emitting diodes. Also, the placement of the lights on an LED TV can differ. The fluorescent lights in an LCD TV are always behind the screen. On an LED TV, the light emitting diodes can be placed either behind the screen or around its edges. The difference in lights and in lighting placement has generally meant that LED TVs can be thinner than LCDs, although this is starting to change. It has also meant that LED TVs run with greater energy efficiency and can provide a clearer, better picture than the general LCD TVs.</p>" +

First, LED TVs work with a color wheel or distinct RGB-colored lights (red, green, blue) to produce more realistic and sharper colors. Second, light emitting diodes can be dimmed. The dimming capability on the back lighting in an LED TV allows the picture to display with a truer black by darkening the lights and blocking more light from passing through the panel. This capability is not present on edge-lit LED TVs; however, edge-lit LED TVs can display a truer white than the fluorescent LED TVs.</p>" +
